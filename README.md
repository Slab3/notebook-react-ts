The project in which I created a notebook with the ability to create subblocks in which there are fields "title" and "body" in which you can enter text, and a field that displays the date of the last change, all data is saved in localstorage, you can also create additional "body" input field inside the subblocks or you can upload a text file and write them in new description item. React JS with hooks were used for development.
